# Help & Issues

We welcome contributions and questions from the community!

## Getting Help

If you have questions about how to use the library, need help with your code, or want to discuss features:

- **Please do not open a GitHub Issue.** Issues are reserved for bug reports and verifiable feature requests.
- Instead, **open a discussion** in the [GitHub Discussions tab](https://github.com/ESP32Async/ESPAsyncWebServer/discussions). This is the best place to get help from maintainers and other users.

## Reporting Issues

If you believe you have found a bug in the library, or if you have a specific feature request:

- Please **open an Issue** on the [GitHub Issues tab](https://github.com/ESP32Async/ESPAsyncWebServer/issues).
- Be sure to include as much detail as possible, including:
  - The version of the library you are using.
  - The hardware you are running on (e.g., ESP32 S3, ESP8266, etc).
  - A minimal code example that reproduces the issue.
  - Any relevant logs or error messages (Enable Core Debug Level to Verbose).
